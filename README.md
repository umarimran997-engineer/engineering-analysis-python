## 🚀 Overview of Projects

### 1. Structural Stress Analysis
- Performs parametric stress evaluation for a component under varying force loads.
- Calculates stress values and compares them with allowable limits.
- Identifies safety margins and decision logic for design evaluation.
- Visualises stress vs force relationships using clear, labelled plots.

### 2. Thermal Parametric Analysis
- Modelling temperature rise for a heated rod under multiple heating scenarios.
- Implements safety factor calculations and design margin assessments.
- Provides decision logic to assess thermal safety across scenarios.
- Produces visual comparisons of temperature profiles.

### 3. EV Energy Consumption & Efficiency Analysis
- Models energy consumption per kilometre for an electric micro-vehicle.
- Includes rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag to compute power demands.
- Performs speed sweeps and optimisation analysis to determine most efficient speed.
- Estimates vehicle range based on battery capacity and consumption values.
- Decision checks at real driving speeds to assess range feasibility.
